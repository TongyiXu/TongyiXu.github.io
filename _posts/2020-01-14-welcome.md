## Challenges and Countermeasures in Deep Learning Practice

Deep learning is a rapidly developing and extremely important field. However, in practice, we often face many challenges:

- Solving deep learning configuration problems can be very difficult because the problems are often technically profound.
- Compatibility issues between different versions occur frequently.
- It is challenging to keep the code running properly due to changes in libraries and external services (such as the DuckDuckGo search engine).
- Although Google search can often provide help, many suggestions may be outdated or wrong.

To address these challenges, the lecture notes mention some feasible countermeasures:

- Using Devcontainers can solve some problems, but external dependencies are still a big challenge.
- The course chooses to use the fast.ai/Pytorch framework developed by Jeremy Howard (now a professor at the University of Queensland, Brisbane).

Overall, deep learning practice is full of challenges. We need to try more, be brave to explore, and flexibly adopt countermeasures in the learning process in order to move forward steadily and ultimately achieve the desired learning outcomes.
